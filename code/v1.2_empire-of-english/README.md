# Empire of English: Conquer Through Communication

A language learning game where players collect resources and build structures by answering English language questions.

## Game Overview

"Empire of English: Conquer Through Communication" is an educational game that combines resource management and base-building mechanics with English language learning. Players control a villager who collects resources (Food and Wood) by correctly identifying parts of speech (nouns and verbs) and uses these resources to construct buildings.

## Game Features

### Villager Movement
- Control the villager using arrow keys or WASD

- Correct answers reward 10 resources of the corresponding type
- Incorrect answers provide feedback and allow retrying

### Resource Management
- Resource counts are displayed in the top UI bar
- Resources are required for constructing buildings
- Strategic resource collection is necessary to progress

### Building Construction
- **Town Center**: Requires 30 Food and 20 Wood to build
- Building button activates when sufficient resources are available
