    "Game Concept #1  \n",
    "**Summary:** In a charming medieval village, players control a villager on a quest to build their first Town Center. By exploring a 2D map, the villager collects food and wood through rapid-fire grammar quizzes that reinforce correct English usage with a touch of whimsy.  \n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**  \n",
    "- Present Phase: Comprehend Meaning  \n",
    "- Practice Phase: Discriminate Correct/Incorrect Usage  \n",
    "**Mechanic:** Recognition (selection) ‚Äì players click on highlighted resource icons and choose the correct answer from multiple options.  \n",
    "**Extra Gameplay Mechanics:**  \n",
    "- Scoring system tracking resource points  \n",
    "- Content randomization from a predefined learning pool  \n",
    "**Step-by-Step: Gameplay Description:**  \n",
    "1. The player navigates the villager on a 2D map where resource icons (e.g., üçé for Food and üå≥ for Wood) are scattered.  \n",
    "2. As the villager nears a resource, the icon highlights to indicate interactivity.  \n",
    "3. Clicking the highlighted icon opens a popup quiz with a simple English grammar question.  \n",
    "4. The player selects an answer; a correct response adds +10 to the corresponding resource counter, while an incorrect answer prompts an immediate retry.  \n",
    "5. The game randomly selects subsequent questions from a preset learning pool.  \n",
    "6. The updated resource bar shows progress toward building the Town Center.  \n",
    "7. Upon gathering sufficient resources, the player triggers a fixed in-game animation to complete the Town Center construction.\n",

    "Game Concept #2  \n",
    "**Summary:** Set on a mysterious treasure island, players guide an adventurer in search of hidden chests. Each chest holds a vocabulary challenge that, once solved, adds shiny tokens to their treasure collection‚Äîcombining exploration with language practice.  \n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**  \n",
    "- Practice Phase: Reinforce Vocabulary  \n",
    "**Mechanic:** Manipulation ‚Äì a drag/drop matching game where players connect words with their correct definitions or images.  \n",
    "**Extra Gameplay Mechanics:**  \n",
    "- Combo bonus for consecutive correct matches  \n",
    "- Randomized vocabulary challenges drawn from a predefined pool  \n",
    "**Step-by-Step: Gameplay Description:**  \n",
    "1. The player navigates an explorer character across an island map littered with secret, glowing treasure chests.  \n",
    "2. Upon approaching a chest, it visually stands out (e.g., through a glow effect) to signal interactability.  \n",
    "3. Clicking the chest opens a quiz interface featuring word-definition pairs or word-image associations.  \n",
    "4. The player drags vocabulary words to their matching definitions or corresponding pictures.  \n",
    "5. A correct match rewards the player with tokens and may trigger a combo bonus if achieved in succession; an incorrect match provides immediate visual feedback without token gain.  \n",
    "6. Each challenge is selected at random from a secure learning content pool.  \n",
    "7. The treasure counter and progress bar update to reflect accumulated rewards, encouraging multiple short play sessions.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Game Concept #3  \n",
    "**Summary:** In a futuristic newsroom, players assume the role of an aspiring radio host. They participate in live broadcasts by accurately repeating pre-selected English phrases to simulate real-world speaking scenarios, with the ultimate goal of progressing through a series of timed broadcasting segments.  \n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**  \n",
    "- Produce Phase: Spontaneous Speaking  \n",
    "- Practice Phase: Reinforce Vocabulary  \n",
    "**Mechanic:** Voice input (pronunciation, repetition) ‚Äì players use their voice to repeat phrases, which the game evaluates using a predefined correct/incorrect logic.  \n",
    "**Extra Gameplay Mechanics:**  \n",
    "- Scoring system based on accuracy and clarity  \n",
    "- Randomization of phrases from a preset content pool  \n",
    "**Step-by-Step: Gameplay Description:**  \n",
    "1. The player enters a dynamic 2D animated newsroom where interactive elements and NPCs set the scene for a live broadcast.  \n",
    "2. A scenario is introduced in which the player must read a specific phrase as a radio announcement.  \n",
    "3. A phrase is randomly selected from a predefined pool and displayed alongside an audio sample.  \n",
    "4. The player speaks the phrase into the microphone, triggering the voice input mechanic.  \n",
    "5. The game compares the input against the expected phrase using simple correct/incorrect criteria; correct attempts increase the score, while incorrect ones trigger a prompt to retry.  \n",
    "6. Visual feedback, such as a progress indicator or celebratory animation, reinforces successful pronunciation.  \n",
    "7. The session lasts between 1‚Äì10 minutes, with each round presenting new phrases to ensure replayability."
